# Eye-of-Providence-II-v2.0
This version comes with Watchlist (as the first) multiple NETSTAT functions/ARP/SYS Info/Remote User/Complete history eraser when it starts up (Won't toss important things, seriously, its safe.) 
Note: I have the watcher set to C:\Users. If you set it to C:\ it will watch the entire system for any new changes.
